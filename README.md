# organize-drive
## Description 
  Project to write a script to organise documents into appropriate folders, primarily for coursework.  
  Running the main script will result in all the files (documents or PDFs) to be organized into the corresponding course's folder.
## Goal 
  To speed up moving files of a specific format to its corresponding folder.
## Primary Use Case
  Using the Google Drive folder on my computer (MacOS) to organize all the unsorted course google documents. 
  While creating a new google doc, it is stored in My Drive, which makes it very cluttered.  
  If I run the script, it should move the google documents from My Drive to the course's folder.
## Format of Files to be Sorted
  (Department Name) (Course Number) - (Name of Document).  
  **NOTE - Any other file in the specified directory will be left untouched.**
